## Episode 1: "The Power Within"
The episode begins with a dramatic scene of Kai using his power to destroy a group of monsters that are attacking the city. As the dust settles, we see him standing alone, panting heavily as he tries to regain control of his power.

Cut to Kai in his high school classroom, where we see him struggling to focus on his studies. His classmates avoid him and he can sense their fear of him. Shiro and Mio, his two friends, are the only ones who treat him normally.

During lunchtime, Shiro and Mio invite Kai to eat with them. They chat about their plans for the weekend, and Shiro mentions a new video game he wants to play. Kai, however, tells them that he can't hang out because he has to work on controlling his power.

After school, Kai goes to a remote location where he practices using his power under the guidance of a mentor who helps him control it. As he trains, we see flashbacks of a tragic incident that happened in the past, where Kai's inability to control his power led to the destruction of a building and the deaths of innocent people.

As the episode comes to a close, we see Kai returning home, exhausted from his training. He lays in his bed, reflecting on his power and the weight of responsibility that comes with it. A voiceover from Kai states, "I want to be able to use my power to protect people, not hurt them. But it's not easy. I have to be in control, always."

As the episode ends, Kai falls asleep, with a determined look on his face, hinting that he's ready to face the challenges ahead.
